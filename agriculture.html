                "The farmer has to be an optimist or he wouldn't still be a farmer." 
                Agriculture, the cultivation of soil, crops, and livestock, is one of humanity's oldest practices, dating back over 10,000 years. It played a critical role in the establishment of civilizations by allowing people to settle in one place, fostering the development of societies.

Early farming involved simple tools and manual labor to grow staple crops such as wheat, rice, and maize, and to domesticate animals like cows and sheep. Over time, agricultural practices advanced significantly. In medieval Europe, the three-field system improved soil fertility and crop yields. The Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century brought mechanization with inventions like the seed drill and mechanical reaper, greatly enhancing productivity.

The 20th century introduced the Green Revolution, which used high-yielding crop varieties, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to boost food production. However, these innovations also led to environmental challenges, including soil degradation, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss.

Modern agriculture integrates advanced technologies such as genetic engineering and precision farming. Genetic engineering produces genetically modified organisms (GMOs) resistant to pests and diseases, while precision farming uses GPS and data analytics to optimize crop management.

Sustainable agriculture is increasingly important, emphasizing practices that protect the environment, public health, and animal welfare. Techniques like crop rotation, organic farming, and agroforestry help maintain soil health, reduce chemical use, and promote biodiversity. Urban agriculture, including rooftop farms and vertical gardens, supports local and sustainable food production.</h3></p>

    Organic farming system in India is not new and is being followed from ancient time. It is a method of farming system which primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such a way, as to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes (crop, animal and farm wastes, aquatic wastes) and other biological materials along with beneficial microbes (biofertilizers) to release nutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in an eco friendly pollution free environment.
    
    As per the definition of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) study team on organic farming ‚Äúorganic farming is a system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and to the maximum extent feasible rely upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade rock additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection‚Äù.
    
    FAO suggested that ‚ÄúOrganic agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity, and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic, biological and mechanical methods in exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs‚Äù.

   <h2> <i><center>The key characteristics of organic farming include</center></i></h2>

      <h3> <li>Protecting the long term fertility of soils by maintaining organic matter levels, encouraging soil biological activity, and careful mechanical intervention</li>
       <li> Providing crop nutrients indirectly using relatively insoluble nutrient sources which are made available to the plant by the action of soil micro-organisms</li>
       <li> Nitrogen self-sufficiency through the use of legumes and biological nitrogen fixation, as well as effective recycling of organic materials including crop residues and livestock manures</li>
      <li>  Weed, disease and pest control relying primarily on crop rotations, natural predators, diversity, organic manuring, resistant varieties and limited (preferably minimal) thermal, biological and chemical intervention</li>
       <li>The extensive management of livestock, paying full regard to their evolutionary adaptations, behavioural needs and animal welfare issues with respect to nutrition, housing, health, breeding and rearing</li>
       <li> Careful attention to the impact of the farming system on the wider environment and the conservation of wildlife and natural habitats</li></h3>
